Every night he would prepare enough dough to produce 1,800 pounds of pasta in addition to 150 pounds of grated cheese and 1,100 pounds of tomato sauce. Before cutting the pasta in different shapes in the morning, Pisghetti would check the engagement of his followers with the pictures posted on Instagram and then make a prediction for the demand of each of his dishes. Then Pisghetti would have 8 hours to cook everything with the help of 2 assistants, Gnochi and Netti, hence implying that among the three of them he had 24 hours of labor at his disposal.\n",
